#### NOTE: **9anime support has been experiencing issues for the past week. It might work but not 100% reliable. Kissanime still works as expected.**

Ever dreamt about watching anime for free effortlessly without all those unbearable ads? Ever dreamt of downloading your favourite anime for that long trip?

## Supported Sites

<!-- [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/vn-ki/anime-downloader/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/vn-ki/anime-downloader/tree/master) -->

- 9anime
- KissAnime [cloudflare]
- KissCartoon [cloudflare]
- Gogoanime

NOTE: To download from sites marked `[cloudflare]`, anime-downloader has to be installed with cloudflare support(See below).

## Installation

You can install the stable release from PyPI.
```bash
$ pip install anime-downloader
```

To install with cloudflare support,
```bash
$ pip install anime-downloader[cloudflare]
```

To install the dev version
```bash
$ pip install -U git+https://github.com/vn-ki/anime-downloader.git

# To install with cloudflare support
$ pip install -U git+https://github.com/vn-ki/anime-downloader.git#egg=anime-downloader[cloudflare]
```

If you have trouble installing, see extended installation instructions [here](https://github.com/vn-ki/anime-downloader/wiki/Installation).

**IMP**:
- For cloudflare scraping [cfscrape](https://github.com/Anorov/cloudflare-scrape) is used. It depends on [`node-js`](https://nodejs.org/en/). So if you want to use cloudflare, make sure you have [node-js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
- You might have to use pip3 depending on your system
- If you are using zsh, don't forget to escape `[` and `]` using `\`.

## Usage

Anime downloader has two sub commands, `dl` and `watch`. You can find the documentation in [wiki](https://github.com/vn-ki/anime-downloader/wiki)

- [dl](https://github.com/vn-ki/anime-downloader/wiki/dl-command): `dl` can download anime.
- [watch](https://github.com/vn-ki/anime-downloader/wiki/watch-command): `watch` can manage your anime watching. Needs [mpv](https://mpv.io). With `watch` you'll never have to go to any anime sites ever again.

#### Search and download

- To search and download all episodes.
```bash
anime dl 'code geass'
```
*NOTE: The above command shows the search results (which would fit you're terminal size :innocent:) and you can select the desired result.*
