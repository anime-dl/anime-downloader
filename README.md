<!-- #### NOTE: **9anime support has been experiencing issues for the past week. It might work but not 100% reliable. Kissanime still works as expected.** -->

```

To install with cloudflare support, (Read note below)
```bash

```

# To install with cloudflare support

```

If you have trouble installing, see extended installation instructions [here](https://github.com/vn-ki/anime-downloader/wiki/Installation).

**NOTE**:
- For cloudflare scraping [cfscrape](https://github.com/Anorov/cloudflare-scrape) is used. It depends on [`node-js`](https://nodejs.org/en/). So if you want to use cloudflare, make sure you have [node-js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
- You might have to use pip3 depending on your system
- If you are using zsh, don't forget to escape `[` and `]` using `\`.

## Usage

See [wiki](https://github.com/vn-ki/anime-downloader/wiki).

Anime downloader has two sub commands, `dl` and `watch`.

- [dl](https://github.com/vn-ki/anime-downloader/wiki/dl-command): `dl` can download anime.
- [watch](https://github.com/vn-ki/anime-downloader/wiki/watch-command): `watch` can manage your anime watch list. Needs [mpv](https://mpv.io). With `watch` you'll never have to go to any anime sites ever again.

### To use `anime_downloader` in your package

This tool can be used as a library. This means you can import it into your own application and search for anime and do many other wonderful things.
See [documentation](https://github.com/vn-ki/anime-downloader/wiki/Package-documentation).

### Development Instructions

See [development instructions](https://github.com/vn-ki/anime-downloader/wiki/Development-Instructions)

*Please don't judge me for not paying for anime. I want to support these animation studios, but being a college student, I can't.*
