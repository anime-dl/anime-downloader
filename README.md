Anime downloader has two sub commands, `dl` and `watch`.

- [dl](https://anime-downlader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/dl.html): `dl` can download anime.
- [watch](https://anime-downlader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/watch.html): `watch` can manage your anime watch list. Needs [mpv](https://mpv.io). Deprecated in favour of [adl](https://github.com/RaitaroH/adl)

**To use `anime_downloader` in your package:**

This tool can be used as a library. This means you can import it into your own application and search for anime and do many other wonderful things.
